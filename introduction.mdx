Emergency Response Management (ERM) is a diverse service trusted and loved by tens of thousands across several experiences on Roblox. Regardless of your role within a roleplay server's team—and we know the vast diversity of roles and responsibilities—ERM is the innovation-driven service that packs a multitude of features into one easy-to-use platform.

The best part? **Our software is free for all users, forever**. We do not have plans to create any paid or exclusive features that are essential for a server's operations—now or at any point in the future.

## Get Started Today

The next step for your server's moderation team is with ERM. To get started with the service, you will first need to [invite the ERM bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=978662093408591912&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands+bot) to your Discord server. Afterwards, you'll want to configure the modules you wish to use within your server.
