title: "Leave of Absences"
description: "Track when staff take time off from your team."
---

Simplify your operations by managing and tracking your team when they aren't able to commit to daily operations. ERM will automatically filter staff on active leave from your server's activity leaderboard and excluding them from other automations with ERM.

## Leave of Absence Configuration

1. Enable the Leave of Absence module: `/config > Basic Settings > LOA Requests` and enable the plugin using the first select menu.
2. Select a role that will be toggled when a user manages their own LOA with the second select menu. (This is optional).
3. Select a log channel where all requests will be sent with the third select menu.

## Create a LOA Request

Staff can run the `/loa request` command and customize the time and reason for their leave of absence.

<Info>
  **Note:** When staff provide a time, confirm that it aligns with the time parsing so ERM understands the duration\!
</Info>

## Delete a LOA Request

Administrators can run the `/loa admin` command and specify a user to manage. On the select menu that appears, click the delete button to remove an active LOA request.

## Remove all LOA Requests

Management can run the `/server manage` command and navigate to the Activity Notices tab. Choose to erase pending notices, active LOA notices, or active RA notices. Keep in mind that erasing active notices does not remove the role from the usersâ€”it only removes their active notice from the database.
