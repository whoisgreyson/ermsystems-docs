## Get started in three steps

We're committed to efficient, simplistic, and robust setup for staff. Use our easy-to-follow our steps below to configure the service.

### 1: Add the bot.

To begin configuring the bot, you'll first need to [invite the bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=978662093408591912&permissions=8&scope=applications.commands+bot) to your server. After it is invited, the server owner will have access to configure permissions, modules, and more.

### 2: Configure permissions.

The server owner can run the `/config` command and modify role-based permissions for staff, administrators, and management.

### 3: Configure modules.

The server owner or users with the management permission can toggle, modify, and configure modules to match the needs of your server. This documentation provides further information about each of the modules.
