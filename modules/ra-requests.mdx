With reduced activity (RA) requests, your staff can inform their supervisors that they are unable to meet their quota for the current wave. With this module, staff can request a hybrid between active and on a leave of absence.

## Reduced Activity Configuration

1. Enable the Leave of Absence module: `/config > Basic Settings > RA Requests` and select the associated role to be toggled for staff on a reduced activity notice.
2. The module will automatically be enabled once you select a role\!

## Create a RA Request

Staff can run the `/ra request` command and customize the time and reason for their reduced activity.

<Info>
  **Note:** When staff provide a time, confirm that it aligns with the time parsing so ERM understands the duration\!
</Info>

## Managing a RA Request

Administrators can run the `/ra admin` command and specify a user to manage. On the select menu that appears, click the delete button to remove an active LOA request.

## Remove all RA Requests

Management can run the `/server manage` command and navigate to the Activity Notices tab. Choose to erase active RA notices. This will remove all active notices from your staff.

<Warning>
  Erasing active RA notices will not remove the role from your staffâ€”it will only remove the records from your server's database.
