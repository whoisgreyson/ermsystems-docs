description: "Record various actions from your moderation team."

It is important to be aware of the actions executed by your server's moderation team—to enforce cooldowns, prevent duplicate messages, and ensure a quality experience for all. With ERM's straightforward logging system, your staff can quickly justify an action they've used in-game.

## Game Logging Configuration

1. Enable the Game Logging module: `/config > Basic Settings > Game Logging` and enable the various logging options using the first three select menus.
2. Select the "More Options" interaction, and configure a logging channel for each of the logs you have enabled.

## Create a Message Log

Run the `/game message` command and paste the announcement that you sent in-game. ERM will forward this record to the configured channel.

## Create a Priority Log

Run the `/game priority` command and provide the duration and reason for the priority. ERM will alert the team of this active priority.

## Create a STS Log

Run the `/game sts` command and provide the duration and reason for the shoulder-to-shoulder event. Your team will have this STS on record, to prevent them from occurring too frequently.

<Tip>
  This module is universal and works with any game\! Whether you roleplay with Emergency Response: Liberty County, Maple County, or another experience on Roblox—recording in-game events is important for your team's records.
