ERM's application system makes it easy to track candidacy for staff, review and manage ban appeals, and more. With applications, your team can ditch Google Forms and integrate all aspects of the service with your forms.

## Applications Configuration

1. Navigate to your server's ERM dashboard with the `/dashboard` command, then click on the "Applications" menu from the top.
2. Click "Create New" and give your application a Title and Description.
3. From there, you are able to personalize the application to fit your server needs.

## Responses
