With one command, your staff can create, view, and manage punishments issued in-game. Best of all, these punishments are automatically integrated with other core features of ERM.

## Roblox Punishments Configuration

1. Enable the Roblox Punishments module: `/config > Basic Settings > Roblox Punishments` and enable the plugin using the first select menu.
2. Select a log channel where all punishments will be sent with the second select menu.

### Optional Configuration

- **More Options:** Select individual channels for ban, kick, and ban BOLO logs.
- **Default Punishments:** Configure the default options for punishment types within your server.

## Create a Punishment Type

You can run the `/punishment manage` command and select the "Manage Types" option to view custom punishment types. From this menu, you can create or delete these types.

## Create a Punishment

Staff can run the `/punish` command to initiate a new punishment log for a Roblox user. With the context command, submit the type of punishment and reason for the action, and then press send. ERM will automatically store the punishment and create a log.

## Modify a Punishment

Administrators can run the `/punishment manage` command and select the "Modify Punishment" option. In the pop-up, specify the punishment ID and submit the form. Staff can then:

- **Change Type:** Edit the current type of punishment.
- **Edit Reason:** Change the reason for the punishment.
- **Delete Punishment:** Permanently remove the punishment from the user's account.

## Remove all LOA Requests

Management can run the `/server manage` command and navigate to the Activity Notices tab. Choose to erase pending notices, active LOA notices, or active RA notices. Keep in mind that erasing active notices does not remove the role from the usersâ€”it only removes their active notice from the database.
