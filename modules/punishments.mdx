title: "Roblox Punishments"

With one command, your staff can create, view, and manage punishments issued in-game. Best of all, these punishments are automatically integrated with other core features of ERM.

## Roblox Punishments Configuration

1. Enable the Roblox Punishments module: `/config > Basic Settings > Roblox Punishments` and enable the plugin using the first select menu.
2. Select a log channel where all punishments will be sent with the second select menu.

### Optional Configuration

## Create a Punishment

Staff can run the `/punish` command to initiate a new punishment log for a Roblox user. With the context command, submit the type of punishment and reason for the action, and then press send. ERM will automatically store the punishment and create a log.

## Delete a LOA Request

Administrators can run the `/loa admin` command and specify a user to manage. On the select menu that appears, click the delete button to remove an active LOA request.

## Remove all LOA Requests

Management can run the `/server manage` command and navigate to the Activity Notices tab. Choose to erase pending notices, active LOA notices, or active RA notices. Keep in mind that erasing active notices does not remove the role from the usersâ€”it only removes their active notice from the database.
