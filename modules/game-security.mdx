Obtain real-time alerts by @mention when a moderator is executing abusive commands in-game. ERM recognizes abusive commands that affect members, such as kicking everyone from the server, banning others, and more.

## Game Security Configuration

1. Enable the Game Security module: `/config > Basic Settings > Game Security` and enable the plugin using the first select menu.
2. Select a channel to monitor for command executions with the second select menu. Usually, these are recorded using a Discord webhook.
3. Select an alert channel where all abusive command will be detected and sent with the third select menu. Additionally, you can select the roles to mention in this alert with the fourth menu.

## Automatic Detection and Notification

Once you have configured the module using the steps above, ERM will automatically begin reviewing each command executed in your private roleplay server. Our advanced detection software will flag any command that could be seen as abusive and alert your team immediately.
