ERM makes it easy for your team to execute commands from in-game using the `:log` command. With this simplicity, your team can eliminate the need to tab back and forth between a moderator panelâ€”and streamline all actions from their Roblox client.

  This module requires the Pro Server gamepass with webhooks configured. You can use [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9tPJGtIe6IQ&pp=ygUaaG93IHRvIGNvbm5ldCB3ZWJob29rcyBwcmM%3D) from PRC to learn how to configure your server to integrate with this feature.

## Log a Punishment

- :log punish [Username] [Action] [Reason]

In this instance, the "Action" is the specific action to punish the user with (warn, kick, ban, etc.).

## Log a Punishment & Moderate the User In-Game

- :log punish [Username] [Action] [Reason] --kick
- :log punish [Username] [Action] [Reason] --ban

In this instance, the "Action" is the specific action to punish the user with (warn, kick, ban, etc.). The suffix at the end tells ERM to execute the specific action on the user in-game, dependent on the type of action you specify.

## Actions & Custom Commands

- :log actions execute [Name]
- :log custom run [Name]

With these options, you are able to execute a custom action or command frmo your in-game server by specifying the name.
