From the moderator panel, your staff have the ability to view, manage, and control everything. Whether they need to manage priorities or toggle a shift, the moderator panel is an all-in-one tool for your staff.

## Personalize your Panel

As a staff member, you are able to personalize your moderator panel to fit the needs of your shifts and duties. You can resize, reconfigure, and even remove widgets from your panel. 

1. Navigate to the bottom left of the ERM website and click the <Icon icon="gear" color="#ffffff" /> icon.
2. At the top of your settings menu, toggle the visibility of each widget.

## Search & Moderate a User

From the "Moderation" widget, you can type a partial or full usernameâ€”and let ERM finish the username for you. The service will then retrieve all associated logs for the user, including recent moderations, account information, and in-game information (if configured with API).

To moderate a user, select a moderation type, specify a reason for the moderation, upload optional proof, and click "Create Moderation" at the bottom. ERM will attach a log to this user's account, accessible on the `/search`  command.

## Shift Management

The moderator panel offers two widgets to help with shift management.

- **Active Staff:** View all staff that are actively on shift.
- **Manage Shift:** Toggle your shift, manage your break, or end your shift.
